### Abstract
Open-world 3D instance segmentation is a recently introduced problem with diverse applications, notably in continually learning
embodied agents. This task involves segmenting unknown instances and
learning new instances when their labels are introduced. However, prior
research in the open-world domain has traditionally addressed the two
sub-problems, namely continual learning and unknown object identification, separately. This approach has resulted in limited performance
on unknown instances and cannot effectively mitigate catastrophic for-
getting. Additionally, these methods bypass the utilization of the information stored in the previous version of the continual learning model,
instead relying on a dedicated memory to store historical data samples,
which inevitably leads to an expansion of the memory budget. In this
paper, we argue that continual learning and unknown class identification
should be tackled in conjunction. Therefore, we propose a new exemplar-
free approach for 3D continual learning and the discovery of unknown
classes through self-distillation. Our approach leverages the pseudo-labels
generated by the model from the preceding task to improve the unknown predictions during training while simultaneously mitigating catastrophic forgetting. By integrating these pseudo-labels into the continual
learning process, we achieve enhanced performance in handling unknown
classes. We validate the efficacy of the proposed approach via comprehensive experiments on various splits of the ScanNet200 dataset, showcasing superior performance in continual learning and unknown class
retrieval compared to the state-of-the-art.
